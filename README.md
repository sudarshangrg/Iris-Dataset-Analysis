# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis & Classification

This project explores and analyzes the famous Iris dataset using various Python libraries and demonstrates how to build a classification model using `scikit-learn`.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers, categorized into three species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.

In this project, we perform:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Feature Selection
- Model Training & Evaluation using various classifiers

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `numpy` | Numerical computations |
| `pandas` | Data manipulation and analysis |
| `matplotlib` | Basic data visualization |
| `seaborn` | Advanced data visualization and plots |
| `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`) | Machine learning model building, training, and evaluation |

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps us understand the dataset's structure and patterns. Key steps included:

- Viewing dataset structure with `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`
- Visualizing feature distributions with `histplot` and `scatterplot`
- Understanding relationships between features and classes

## 🤖 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoding target classes
   - Splitting data into train/test sets using `train_test_split`

2. **Model Training**  
   Algorithms used:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
  
3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score

## 📈 Results

Each model was evaluated, and performance metrics were compared to choose the best performing classifier. Visual plots like confusion matrices and decision boundaries (when applicable) were also used for comparison.
